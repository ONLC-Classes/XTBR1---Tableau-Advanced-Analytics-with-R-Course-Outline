Overview
Moving from data visualization into deeper, more advanced analytics? This course will intensify data skills for data viz-savvy users who want to move into analytics and data science in order to enhance their businesses by harnessing the analytical power of R and the stunning visualization capabilities of Tableau.

Together, Tableau and R offer accessible analytics by allowing a combination of easy-to-use data visualization along with industry-standard, robust statistical computation. Readers will come across a wide range of machine learning algorithms and learn how descriptive, prescriptive, predictive, and visually appealing analytical solutions can be designed with R and Tableau.

In order to maximize learning, hands-on examples will ease the transition from being a data-savvy user to a data analyst using sound statistical tools to perform advanced analytics.

Audience
This class is for Tableau users who are comfortable with the product and are ready to transition to from being a data-savvy user to being a data analyst using sound statistical tools to perform advanced analytics.

Prerequisites
Before attending this course, students should have taken or be familiar with the contents presented in Tableau Desktop Level 1: Introduction and the Tableau Desktop 2: Intermediate courses.

What You Will Learn
Integrate Tableaus analytics with the industry-standard, statistical prowess of R.

Make R function calls in Tableau, visualizing R functions with Tableau using RServe.

Use the CRISP-DM methodology to create a roadmap for analytics investigations.

Implement various supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms in R that return values to Tableau.

Get to grips with advanced calculations in R and Tableau for analytics and prediction with the help of use cases and hands-on examples.
Make quick, cogent, and data-driven decisions for your business using advanced analytical techniques such as forecasting, predictions, association rules, clustering, classification, and other advanced Tableau R calculated field functions.
